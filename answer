1) What is the definition of Hive? What is the present version of Hive?
answer :- hive is dataware house which will run on top of hadoop.
present version is hive 3.1.3.

2) Is Hive suitable to be used for OLTP systems? Why?
answer:-- No Hive does not provide insert and update at row level. So it is not suitable for OLTP system.

3) How is HIVE different from RDBMS? Does hive support ACID transactions. If not then give the proper reason.
answer:-- hive is only of used for maintain data warehouse.
it will run on HQL .Hive supports ACID transactions on tables that store ORC file format.

4)Explain the hive architecture and the different components of a Hive architecture?
hive architecture.
-----------------

1)multiple clients like thrift app, jdbc app, odbc app.

2)client will gives data to driver .
3)driver to compiler 
4)driver to metastore
5)driver to optimizer.
6) the driver output goes to mapreduce and yarn part.
7)map reduces, yarn  (resource management and processing)
8)mapreduce to hdfs part file receives
9)last is hdfs this is for storage of file

5)Mention what Hive query processor does? And Mention what are the components of a Hive query processor?
answer:-- Hive query processor convert graph of MapReduce jobs with the execution time framework.
Parse and Semantic Analysis (ql/parse)
Metadata Layer (ql/metadata)
Type Interfaces (ql/typeinfo)
Sessions (ql/session)
Map/Reduce Execution Engine (ql/exec)
Plan Components (ql/plan)
Hive Function Framework (ql/udf)
Tools (ql/tools).

6) what are the 3 modes in which we can operate hive?
answer:-- Standalone Mode.
Pseudo-distributed Mode.
Fully-Distributed Mode.

7) What are the features and limitations of hive?
 answer:--
Limitations of Hive
Hive doesn't support OLTP. Hive supports Online Analytical Processing (OLAP), but not Online Transaction Processing (OLTP).
It doesn't support subqueries.
It has a high latency.
Hive's Features
Hive is designed for querying and managing only structured data stored in tables.
Hive is scalable, fast, and uses familiar concepts.
Schema gets stored in a database, while processed data goes into a Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)

8) How to create a Database in HIVE?
answer:-- create database name.

9) How to create a table in HIVE?
answer:-- create table name( id, name etc).
row format delimited .
fields terminated by some limitation;

10) What do you mean by describe and describe extended and describe
formatted with respect to database and table.
answer:--
describe extended - This will show table columns, data types, and other details of the table. 
Other details will be displayed in single line.
describe formatted - This will show table columns, data types, and other details of the table.
Other details will be displayed into multiple lines

11)How to skip header rows from a table in Hive?
answer:-- by using tabular properties like 
tbl properties("skip.header.line.count"= "1")

12)What is a hive operator? What are the different types of hive operators?
answer:-- Hive operators are used for mathematical operations on operands. It returns specific value as per the logic applied.
There are four types of operators in Hive:
Relational Operators.
Arithmetic Operators.
Logical Operators.
Complex Operators.

13) 13.Explain about the Hive Built-In Functions
answer:-- The Hive Built-in functions are categorized as Mathematical function, Collection function, Type conversion function, Date function, Conditional function, and String function. 

14)write hive DDL and DML commands.
The various Hive DML commands are:
LOAD.
SELECT.
INSERT.
DELETE.
UPDATE.

The several types of Hive DDL commands are:
CREATE.
SHOW.
DESCRIBE.
USE.
DROP.
ALTER.
EXPORT.
IMPORT.
TRUNCATE.

15)15.Explain about SORT BY, ORDER BY, DISTRIBUTE BY and
CLUSTER BY in Hive.
answer:-- sort by:
That means the files are sorted per reducer basis only, and not globally. 
Note that the final output data is not globally sorted and may have overlapping data ranges.

order by :
ORDER BY clause orders the data globally.
Because it ensures the global ordering of the data, all the data need to be passed from a single reducer only.

distribute by:
DISTRIBUTE BY clause is used to distribute the input rows among reducers. 
It ensures that all rows for the same key columns are going to the same reducer. 
the DISTRIBUTE BY clause may output N number of unsorted files where N is the number of reducers used in the query processing.
But, the output files do not contain overlapping data ranges.

clusterby:
CLUSTER BY clause is a combination of DISTRIBUTE BY and SORT BY clauses together.
That means the output of the CLUSTER BY clause is equivalent to the output of DISTRIBUTE BY + SORT BY clauses. 
As a result, the order by clause outputs one single file only. 

16) Difference between "Internal Table" and "External Table" and Mention
when to choose “Internal Table” and “External Table” in Hive?
answer:--internal table 
   if we table metadata will be stored in meta store 
	data of the table will be stored in warehouse directory inside hdfs configured for hive.
	if we drop a internal table then its metadata & original data both,will be removed
2)external table:---
  meta data will be stored in metastore.
	raw data will not be stored in hive warehouse directory but it will stored in hdfs location .
	it is like external reference to the raw data.
	if we remove the table then only metadata will be deleted but original data will be untouched .
